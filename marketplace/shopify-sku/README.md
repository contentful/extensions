# Shopify app

The Shopify app allows editors to select products from their Shopify account and reference them inside of Contentful entries.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install

This app can be installed for fields of type `Short text` or `List of short text`.

To install this app you have to:

- Sign up with Shopify and [create an API client]() to acquire the necessary credentials.
- Fill in all data pertaining to your Shopify account in the installation screen.
- Select all fields for which you'd like to install the Shopify app from the list of available fields.
- Click on `Install`

This will modify the fields in the selected content types and change their appearance to use the Shopify app.

### Step 2: Navigate to entries and start adding products

After a successful installation you can directly navigate to the content entries where the Shopify app is set up.

You will be able to link plain `Short text` fields to a single product in your Shopify account.

Lists of `Short text` fields can be linked to a selection of many products.
