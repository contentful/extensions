Integrate with Commerce Layer's SKU.

This extension lets you visually associate an SKU to any model on Contentful.
The association brings the SKU `code` into the content model, so that you can make it shoppable on the front-end by leveraging the Commerce Layer API.

To set up the extension you need an account with CommerceLayer and will need to create a Contentful Application from the settings section of your CommerceLayer store. Once this is complete CommerceLayer will provide you a `Client Secret`, `Client ID` and `Store URL` that can be used to configure this extension.
