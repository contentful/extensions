# Contentful extensions repository (unmaintained)

This repo is unmaintained in favor of [apps](https://github.com/contentful/apps). We strongly recommend investing into Apps instead of UI Extensions going forward. Learn how to [build your first app](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/tutorial/).
If you’ve run into any issue, please let us know and we’ll resolve it as soon as possible.

This repository provides samples of Contentful UI extensions, developed using the [UI Extensions SDK](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/ui-extensions/sdk-reference/).
