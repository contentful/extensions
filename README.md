# Contentful extensions repository

This repository provides samples of Contentful UI extensions, developed using the [UI Extensions SDK](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/ui-extensions/sdk-reference/). 

If you don't know what UI Extensions are or how to use them, please refer to our [documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/ui-extensions/).

## Marketplace extensions

This folder contains officially maintained, production quality extensions that are ready to use. You can easily install them from the [Extension Marketplace](https://www.contentful.com/developers/marketplace/).

## UI extension examples

We are offering a currated list of UI Extension examples under [samples](./samples) which demonstrate many popular use cases such as working with digital asset management, talking to third party APIs, doing OAuth or trigger builds.

## Core field editor extensions

We're progressively opening our [core field editors](./core-field-editors) within this repository, allowing you to understand how each component works, and create your own extensions based on them rather than starting from scratch.
