This extension translates text from the default locale to other locales in a space using the [Yandex](https://translate.yandex.com/) translation API.

## Installation and usage

[Check you have the requirements needed](../README.md#extensions-samples) to use our extensions.

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Create the extension:

```bash
contentful extension create --space-id <yourSpaceId>
```

Serve on _<http://localhost:3000>_:

```bash
npm start
```

You can provide a value for the `PORT` environment variable to start the server on a custom port. If you do, remember to update the `src` property in _extension.json_.

```bash
export PORT=<custom-port>
npm start
```

Your extension will now be accessible in the Contentful web app. To use the extension, create a content type with a field of type 'Symbol' or 'Text'. You will need to enable localization on the field to use the translation feature.

The [same constraints](../README.md#debugging-on-your-local-environment) apply to loading unsafe scripts.

### Upload extension

If you want to inline all dependencies and upload the extension to Contentful, run the following command:

```bash
contentful extension create --srcdoc ./dist/index.all.html --space-id <space-id> --force
```

And to update the extension:

```bash
contentful extension update --srcdoc ./dist/index.all.html --space-id <space-id> --force
```
