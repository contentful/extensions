### 2. Deploy the Lambda function

Now that you have these credentials you can deploy your Lambda function to your desired platform.

[Here is the code for the lambda function](./lambda-function.js) that you will be deploying.

Copy the API_KEY you have from step 1 into the Environment Variables section of your lambda hosting platform. Here is the names of the variable you will be adding to that section. **Make sure the key name is added exactly as below otherwise your lambda function won't work**.

```
WISTIA_API_KEY=
```
